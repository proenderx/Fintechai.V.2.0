## Project Summary

**FinTech AI Agent** is a full-stack web application built with Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase. It helps users (gig workers, exporters, students, etc.) make smarter financial decisions through three main AI-driven modules:

1. **Export Advisor**: Suggests alternative export markets with simulated profit/tax analysis.
2. **Investment & Market Insights**: Shows a live trading chart, technical indicators, and simulated AI insights.
3. **Personal Money Management**: Analyzes expenses and suggests savings/allocation strategies.

Features include Firebase Auth, a modern dashboard, responsive design, and a clean, expandable codebase. All AI/logic is simulated for demo purposes.
